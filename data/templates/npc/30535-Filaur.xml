The Gray Column Guild is an association of architects and miners, who hold the secrets of geometry, measurement, construction and mechanics that our ancestors learned from Maphr. Our mine engineers developed the enormous mining region of the Spine Mountains, and our architects built the great underground labyrinth of Mlan. Our guild also runs strip mines in this village and in the Mithril Mines.<br>
But if you think that we just build tunnels all the time, you are mistaken. Our guild also dispatches scouts to find new veins, and we cross the ocean to import precious metals like oriharukon and chrisolites from Gracia.<br>

500 years ago at Mlan, when the great Kingdom of the Dwarves was defeated by Humans and Orcs, the King himself fought against the invaders to the very last, to earn time for his people to take refuge in the mountains. Since then, the throne has been empty.<br>
Although seniors of the Guild Association govern the kingdom for now, they are only proxies of the king, and no one thinks they are the true rulers of the kingdom. This is due to the legend of the king's return handed down among the Dwarves. Have you heard it? The legend says that some day a descendant of the king will be found, to expel all the oppressors and lead us to the new golden age ...<br>
