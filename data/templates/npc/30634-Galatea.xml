High level elementals have the ability to converse intelligently with Humans, as they are the ruling class of their race. The Magicians of the Ivory Tower have defined the hierarchy of elementals into Turen, Tilpo, and Liebe.<br>
The elementals that have appeared in Gludio are; the Flame Salamander, Earth Wyrm, and Water Undine. Originally, these elementals could only be found in hot magmatic regions, high in the skies, in the vast desert, or within the Deep Sea Waters. But now they are here... It is noteworthy indeed that they have appeared in Human lands.<br>
Have you actually seen any of these elementals?
