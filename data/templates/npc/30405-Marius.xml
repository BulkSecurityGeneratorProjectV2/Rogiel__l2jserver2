He is one of the lords of the Kingdom of Aden, across the ocean in the land of Gludio. He pledged loyalty to King Amadeo and was awarded the title and rank of baron. He is one of very few who I have met who is worthy of being called a true Knight.

I am Marius Graymist. Originally, I am from the Elven Forest, but I have served as a knight under <font color="LEVEL">Baron Waldner</font> of Gludio for the past 30 years. I fought with the Baron's royal guards in the war against Elmore and the assault of Gracia.<br>
However, I have retired and am living quietly in this secluded place. I write poetry and music, and study history as a hobby ... blood-stained Human history ...<br>
