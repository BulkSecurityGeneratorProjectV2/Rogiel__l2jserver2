Welcome! I am Gatekeeper Roxxy, dispatched from the Ivory Tower. I'm very happy to return to my hometown. Have you perhaps been to Einhovant's School of Magic? Grand Magister Gallint was my old teacher. Now then, how can I help you?<br>

The Ivory Tower is the foremost temple of all Mystics. It has been well known as such ever since the age of Elmoreden. I was born here, and graduated from Einhovant's School of Wizardry. And now, I am working as a gatekeeper by the order of the Ivory Tower. If you happen to go to the Ivory Tower later on, please give my best regards to Grand Magister Valerie. She is my teacher and a wonderful, caring person.<br>

The Airship Field is where Airships heading to and from <font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font> dock. A powerful magic force field prevents entry to Gracia from sea or via teleportation.<br>
But Gracian-made Airships can travel safely through the force field. It is still a dangerous journey, though!<br>After several years of work, a wharf was constructed from magical stones capable of floating in mid-air. You can board one of the Airships using an <font color="LEVEL">Airship Controller</font>.<br>
If you wish to visit Gracia, this is the only way. I can teleport you to the wharf if you wish.<br>
