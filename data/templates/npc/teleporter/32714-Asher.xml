For thousands of years, Primeval Isle had been sealed to prevent its inhabitants from leaving through this Gate. Now, however, adventurers' activities seem to have finally weakened the seal enough to permit departures.<br>
You may now teleport to the mainland, but only to Rune Township. Would you like to do so?<br>

Since the the seal was broken, various trees on the island have begun to "leak" large amounts of Mana, drawing it out from reserves far underground.<br>
It is now possible to regenerate MP simply by standing near some of these large trees!
