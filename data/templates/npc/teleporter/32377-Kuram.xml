Only parties with more than 7 members can participate in the game and, if they win, keep playing. You can also only participate in the arena reserved for your level.<br>
When you enter the arena, you will see a Tower of Resurrection for each team. Until you destroy your opponents' tower, it will continue to resurrect them. Take a look around the arena to understand how it will affect the battle. This is about more than simple combat, you know...<br>
Remember also that any buff applied to the team will be negated if one of the members does not meet its level requirements. Another bit of advice: consider stationing the team member who is best at solo matches on the front line.<br>
Now, then -- ready to prove just how good you really are?

No team currently has consecutive wins. Just goes to show you how hard it is to find a really skilled team these days...

This is a list of the teams planning to participate in this match. Impressive, aren't they? But don't be intimidated. Knowing your opponents and their capabilities is good strategy in fact.<br><br>

What's that? You want to enter by yourself? Sorry, kid -- it doesn't work that way. If you want to participate, go find yourself a team.
