I was also a famous Treasure Hunter when I was  young... I was the one who retrieved the legendary Star Sapphire Crown from the Lost Harenak. In those days, they called me Aden's silver fox.<br>
You've never heard of that name? Sigh... Well, it was a very long time ago...

Why, greetings! I see you are a frequent traveler. Well, have you been here and there?<br>
Since I got married, I am at home all day long, so sometimes I feel stifled. These days, I recollect the old memories of when I roamed around the kingdom. There were many hardships, but I miss the days when I could enjoy adventure and romance ...<br>
