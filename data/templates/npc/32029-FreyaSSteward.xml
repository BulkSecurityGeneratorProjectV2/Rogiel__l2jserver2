Welcome to the castle of the great Queen Freya. This place is open to the public per the Ice Queen's instruction, though the queen doesn't like noise. Please try to be quiet.<br><br>

Sirra rejected the romantic attentions of the Captain of the Royal Guard. He is still in love with her, however, and he guards her from any outsiders who may disturb her.  The Captain draws his power from the mystic who is protecting Sirra, so if you vanquish the Captain, you will likely hurt the mystic as well.<br>

It is fortunate for us that Freya is absent for we could never dare to threaten her favored pets otherwise.  We will lure them forth with the Silver Hemocytes you gave me.<br>
If you enter the garden before the gate closes, I will be unable to help you at all. Therefore, please make your move after the gate has closed. Until then, you may wait here and make your preparations as you think best.  Never forget:  Your goal is to get rid of  the Ice Fairy Sirra, a pest who is unjustly favored by the Queen.<br>

Our only intelligence on these creatures is that if you defeat them, Ice Fairy Sirra will become vulnerable to physical attack.<br>

The Ice Fairy Sirra was once Freya's maid before Freya became the Ice Queen.  For reasons we do not know, she was transformed into a solid block of ice. Freya made a bargain through prayer for Sirra's life, but could not accept her new incarnation and left Freya's service.<br>
Even though her anger and torment overwhelmed her, Sirra remained close to her former master and thus, came to stay in Freya's garden. We have recently learned that the Ice Queen also granted Sirra the power to draw from the life force of any creature within the garden. Thus, if you kill the creatures of the garden first, it will be easier for you to kill the Ice Fairy.<br>

That is fine. Let us prepare for your ordeal. We will have an appropriate fighting arena prepared for you shortly, so make yourselves ready and wait here until the gate is closed. If you do not remain here until then, I cannot help you.<br>
