That place...it was hellish. Everyone became slaves to the Demons because of that accursed tyrant Beleth. I'm beside myself with worry about my brother and the other family I left behind on the island. The structure beside you was specially designed to allow entry into Hellbound, wasn't it? If only it was operational! I don't know how to activate it, but I heard that someone from the Ivory Tower does. The name was G...Ga...Galate -- yes, that's it! Galate! You can find her on your way to Innadril.
