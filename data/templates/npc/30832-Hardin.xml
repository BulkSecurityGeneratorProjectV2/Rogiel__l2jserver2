Many people are unnecessarily frightened of Necromancers. Humans have an irrational fear of blood and that seems to drive their prejudice. Basicaly, a Necromancer is just a person who studies the lives of humans and other living beings. This knowledge was passed down from the time of the Titans.<br>
there are two types of necromancy: Healing and ressurection.<br>
If you want to learn about necromancy, you have come to the right place. Good luck!<br>

Greetings. I am the Mystic known as Hardin. I am sure that my reputation precedes me. Am I as you expected?<br>
Although I am an alumnus of the Ivory Tower, I detested the elitism there. Perhaps it was because of my youth, but... Anyway, I took my opinions very seriously at that time...<br>
Let me know if you have any question. While this school is open for everyone, magic is only taught to my pupils...<br>

Oh, you mean this cave? It is very well-suited to the needs of my pupils and myself. Does it seems a little rustic? Lich King Icarus could answer more of your questions about this place. He was the original owner here.<br>
I'm the second or third... I met him shortly after having left my master... I won this cave in a contest. Just as well, as he had been using it for no good. Of course nothing much ever came of anything Lich King Icarus did, good or bad...<br>

The Mystic Beleth graduated from the Ivory Tower during the time of Elmoreden. He had such an awesome power that he seemed immortal even then. He became greedy and misused his power to such a degree that he became known as a demon...<br>
But why do you want to know about him...? Do you think I know something anyone else couldn't tell you?<br>
Perhaps you think I had a relationship with Beleth?<br>
