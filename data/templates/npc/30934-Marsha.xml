Starstones... known amongst the wizards as nebulite... A very rare mineral indeed! It comes to us upon meteorites.<br>
It was much more common in ancient times. Titans used it as a power source for their fantastic machines.<br>

Merciful heavens, you startled me! How did you sneak up on me like that?!<br>
Anyway, it's nice to meet you! I am Collector Marsha, an expert in exotic substances. I am here searching for Starstones. I had no idea this place was so dangerous! Earlier I was nearly killed, and now I fear for my older brother!<br>

My older brother Trumpin is also a collector. He is very diligent and capable, although he does have a weakness for games of chance. I have watched him gamble away all his savings.<br>
Actually I saw him not too long ago. We were running away from monster eyes and became separated. He must still be somewhere in this crater...<br>
