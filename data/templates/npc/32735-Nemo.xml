I have no information about the origins of this species, but what I have found is that these creatures do possess a unique energy, sort of plasma if you will.�Hmm� <font color="LEVEL">Maguen Plasma</font>. I like that.�I think that is what I�ll call it. Anyway, when a Maguen appears it begins to bring forth one of these plasmas. It will also cycle through its various plasmas before hiding.<br>
With Blacksmith Kusto�s talent and my magic we were able to create a device that could harvest these plasmas� a <font color="LEVEL">Maguen Plasma Collector</font>. I know it isn�t too creative but we decided to keep the name simple to avoid explaining what it does.�<br>
Ugh� fine. I�ll explain it to you. When you are in the Seed and a Maguen appears you have a very limited time to collect the Maguen Plasma. If you don�t collect the plasma in time the Maguen will go back into hiding. I�ve set up a practice Maguen if you want to try using the Maguen Plasma Collector.<br>
This isn�t a real Maguen, so you won�t collect any Plasma� just thought you should know so you don�t get your hopes up.<br>

Who are you? What business do you have with the Great Magician of Oren? Speak! Hmm� not a chatty one, are you? Well if you must know, I am here on important business.<br>
It is said that a mysterious creature can only be found on this Seed. Have you heard of a <br>
<font color="LEVEL">Maguen</font>? Yes, I know it is a silly name. But aren�t you the least bit intrigued?<br>

Are you pulling my leg? You're NOT an adventurer? Or you ARE? You have one? You want another? What is it?! Tell me!!<br> You've confused me. I don't know what to say... I need a moment...

Take a look at the top of the Maguen�s head. Observe the aura of the Plasma that the Maguen is producing. Use the Maguen Plasma Collector when the Maguen summons the Plasma you wish to collect.
