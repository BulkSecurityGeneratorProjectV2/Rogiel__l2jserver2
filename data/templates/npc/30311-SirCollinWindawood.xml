This tower was erected 514 years before the empire was formed, as a memorial to the Elven victory over the Orcs. The Elves won because they had allied with the Humans and taught them magic as they fought together.<br>
However, in the end, the Elves were also betrayed by the Humans and, like the defeated Orcs, they were chased to the outskirts of the continent... The noble Elves, who had ruled the land after the giants of ere, were ultimately pushed aside by the Humans whom they had considered worthless... Don't you think history is, ultimately, just a cruel joke?

This island was originally the sacred ground of the Elves of Light. I heard they were powerful enchanters, who communed with spirits. At the time when the Elves began the war with the Orcs, they also began to teach Humans magic to increase their army's strength. Thus, they built the School of Wizardry here, and selected and trained magically talented Humans.<br>
However, after the Humans betrayed the Elves, the Elves all returned to the forest and the School of Wizardry was abandoned. Now it is infested with dangerous monsters. I, too, do not know what to do now...

Nice to meet you, young traveler. This edifice is the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory.</font> I don't know if you are interested in history, but there are many historic relics of ancient Talking Island in this area. This tower here was built a thousand years ago and to the west you can find the ancient <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins.</font><br>
