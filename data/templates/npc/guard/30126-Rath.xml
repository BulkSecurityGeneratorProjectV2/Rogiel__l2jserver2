There are all sorts of rumors about the great Wizard Hardin, but hardly anyone knows his true identity. Some say the demon Beleth is actually Hardin, others say that Hardin is the one who cursed the Dark Elves, and yet others say he helped King Rauhel unify the kingdom of Aden. I don't know what is true, but anyway, from the stories he seems to be the most powerful of all Wizards, don't you think?

Rumor has it that the<font color="LEVEL"> Great Wizard Hardin</font> lives somewhere within the northern mountain range. Many young people have gone in search of that place to learn magic from him, but no one has actually met him yet. Those who say they have met him are liars.<br>
