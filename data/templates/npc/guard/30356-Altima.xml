This is the vast forest where our people have been living from ancient times, although now it is dispoiled by barbarous goblins and orcs. One day we Sentries will drive all of the filthy intruders out of the forest.,br>
The Dark Forest begins at the edge of the village. If you continue on the path to the souththwest, you will arrive in the region of Gludio, where Humans live. You can ask Sentry Marion or Kayleen at the entrance of the cave for more details. Both are well informed on the geography of the forest.

May the Song of the west wind bring you rest in the night. I am Sentry Altima. I admit that I have a soft nature. I applied to become a Sentry to change my cowardly character. Now, as you can see, I have been reborn as a strong Sentry.<br>
If you follow this path that I guard, you can go out towards the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Forest.</font><br>
