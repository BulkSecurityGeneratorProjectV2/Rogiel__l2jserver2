Howdy, stranger! Welcome! You're really brave to be here at a time like this! Or just lucky maybe? Ha!<br>
I've had enough of danger myself, thank you! I'd rather stay home and relax with my georgeous wife! When the stakatos are driven out of the Swamp of Screams and the land is cultivated, I'll be the first to build my own farm!<br>
Well, first I have to find a georgeous wife... Can you believe I'm still single?!<br>

The<font color="LEVEL"> Swamp of Screams</font>? It's a very dangerous place.<br>
The stakatos are ferocious and the water in the swamp is poisonous. I hear you become addicted when you get near the water, you don't even have to drink it!<br>
The Golden Ram Mercenary Force was hired to wipe them out. Best to use the experts, you'd need a miracle to survive there!<br>
