They say Giran is the wealthiest region in the kingdom. Once, I traveled to Giran escorting the coaches of some traders, and their market was enormous. Traders from all over the continent were selling all sorts of novelties. I am thinking of going back there someday to buy a dress of Avella silk for my wife.<br>

Be careful! This place is very crowded because of construction on the village wall. Wooden props may collapse or bricks may fall, so be on alert.<br>
Many are experiencing discomfort due to the construction. In particular, the Traders from <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font> have many complaints. I hope the construction is finished quickly so that the travelers can enter the village through a proper gate.<br>

Recently a very interesting archeological site has been discovered whose origins are still unclear. People who have seen it say that it is divided in two, a Temple of Fire and a Temple of Water. By all accounts the place is swarming with monsters.<br>If you are interested, you should visit <font color="LEVEL">Magister Nell</font> of the Mystics Guild. They are trying to hire someone to investigate the site for them.<br>
