Gludin is a large port village on the southwest coast. Ships to Talking Island depart from there regularly.<br>
If you want to go to the village of Gludin, take this road west until you come to a fork in the road, then take the road that goes southwest. You have to pass the Abandoned Camp, where ol mahum deserters are encamped, so be particularly careful.<br>

Welcome, traveler. Have you come to rest in our beautiful village? Or are you on the brink of beginning a new journey? If you follow the road in front of me to the west, you can pass the <font color="LEVEL">Abandoned Camp</font> and go all the way to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin.</font><br>

If you follow this road west, you will come to a fork in the road. If you turn to the southwest, you will pass the Abandoned Camp. Once, it was a camp for the Gracian armies, but it has been abandoned for some time and is now the camp for the ol mahums.<br>
Those nasty ol mahums were hired by Gracia as mercenaries, but they were unable to return to their country and were left here to plunder for a living. So you must be extra careful when you're traveling near there, or you may be ambushed by ol mahum looters.<br>
