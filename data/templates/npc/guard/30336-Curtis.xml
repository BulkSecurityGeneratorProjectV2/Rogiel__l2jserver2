If you are thinking of leaving the village, I give you one warning. Beyond that mountain in the south is a place called the<font color="LEVEL"> Ruins of Despair</font>. It is an extremely dangerous place so try to stay far away from it. Of course, if you insist on going, I am not going to stop you ...<br>

The Ruins of Despair were originally the village of Lostern. Before the war, it was a prosperous farm village, but the Gracian army reduced it to ashes. The ghosts of the soldiers that were cruelly slaughtered while trying to protect the village still roam there, with their swords and bows, not knowing that the war is over.<br>
Not long ago, the lord dispatched some workers to reconstruct the village, but they were all killed by the undead. I hope it's clear to you how dangerous it is.<br>
Of course, even after they are warned, many young people believe the rumors of hidden relics and go out hunting for them ...<br>
