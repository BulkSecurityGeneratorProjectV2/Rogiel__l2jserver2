You are a new face. Have you come from foreign lands? You must know that Dion s local specialty is the <font color="LEVEL">mandragora!</font> Well then, do you know where the largest Mandragora Farm in Dion is? If you just follow the road in front of me, you can take a look at <font color="LEVEL">Aaron Nightshade's</font> Mandragora Farm, the largest mandragora operation in Dion.<br>

You don't know anything, do you? To think that you are unfamiliar with mandragoras. Listen carefully -- the extract and leaves of a mandragora have the ability to make a dying man jump right out of his bed. It also has many other mysterious powers -- Mystics are always conducting research on it, but they say there is still much left to be learned.<br>
Growing mandragoras definitely guarantees a high profit, but if you are not careful you could lose your life. It is a dangerous plant. When you pass the Mandragora Farm, make sure to cover your ears, or their cries will rip your eardrums.<br>
