Talking Island may look peaceful at first glance, but if you go outside of the village, it is a very dangerous place. There are beasts like wolves and giant spiders, and savage tribes like the Orcs and werewolves. Therefore, if you wander around the island carelessly, you may lose your life.<br>
In particular, Orcs travel around in groups so you must be extra careful of their approach. Recently, there have been rumors that they are frequently around the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory.</font> Be careful.<br>

It is a tower built by the Elves who lived on this island a long time ago. As I heard it, it was erected to celebrate victory in a battle between the Elves and Orcs 2,000 years ago. At the time, the Elves won the war because Humans joined the Elven forces.<br>
You can reach the Obelisk of Victory by following this road to the northwest. As I've already told you, there are many orcs near the tower. You must be careful, because they travel in gangs. Fighter orcs are especially brutal beasts, and will recklessly hurl themselves at Humans. Of course, they are far inferior to those Orcs that fought the Elves of the past.
