Having the border so close to the capital city makes me very nervous. Things have quited down now, but if Elmore were tp attack I fear that the border guards would not be able to resist at all. There was talk for a while of opening the border entirely, but now they seem to be on a higher level of alert than ever before. I pray that nothing triggers the resumption of hostilities...<br>

Nothing more than the Goddard territory of Elmore. There's a settlement I know there called Goddard Village, extremely impoverished since the war. While his citizens starve Elmore still plans another attack upon Aden. He has raised huge offensive castles! I pity the people that live there...<br>
After the war, the situation in Aden was also bleak, but thanks to the ingenuity of His Royal Highness Amadeo, we have recovered nicely. My lord is younger than I am, and really quite amazing...<br>
