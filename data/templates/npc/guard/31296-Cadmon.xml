Hey, stranger! You'd better be careful if you leave this village! Things have gotten very dangerous out there! Tensions have reached the boiling point between the<font color="LEVEL"> Varka Silenos of the west</font> and the<font color="LEVEL"> Ketra Orcs of the north</font>! Even if they kill each other off, there are worse beasts to replace them! Well, come to think of it, if they kill each other off, our guards would have things a bit easier... <br>
You should definitely stay out of their way!<br>

Wow! I knew you were from the south, but I didn't realize how ignorant you were!<br>
The Varka are the most powerful tribe among the Silenos! During the war with Aden, our late king hired them as mercenaries. Unfortunately, after the war they settled down in this region.<br>
You have Silenos in the south too, right? Well, don't be mistaken... The Varka are a different breed all together! They are formidable beasts that are at least equal to the Ketra Orcs in ferocity. Do you know what I mean?<br>

Ketra Orcs? Those mad creatures insist that Goddard belongs to them! But they are so formidable, we can't dismiss them.<br>
They've set up camp in the north of this village. Until recently, they seemed to think that they could take over... But the Varka Silenos have silenced their crazy ambitions for now... I suppose we owe the Varka our gratitude..?<br>
