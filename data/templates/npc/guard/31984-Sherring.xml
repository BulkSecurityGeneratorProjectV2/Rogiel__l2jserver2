According to legend, the Ice Queen's Castle was once a beautiful palace, built by seven Dwarven Maestros as a tribute to the Elven Magician Preya.<br>
But something dreadful happened to Preya, and she became the horrifying witch that we now call the Ice Queen. Since that day, the whole region has been covered in snow and ice! her bitterness must have caused it... Still, I'm sure the Ice Castle is a wonder to behold!<br>
You mustn't venture too far inside, however. There are Ice Spirits there!<br>

Ten-hut! Guard Sherring at your service! Do you require a guide?<br>
To the east of the village you'll find a passage to the mining region and the Plunderous Plains, and to the west you'll find the Crypts of Disgrace and the Den of Evil. It's not easy to get there, but the Ice Queen's Castle is a good place to start.<br>
