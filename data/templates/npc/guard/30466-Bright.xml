The place seems to smell of blood all day long. It is right next to the execution ground, where the undead lurch around. If you ask me, that Aaron Nightshade fellow must truly be out of his mind to grow mandragoras in a place like that.<br>

Look here, are you going to the<font color="LEVEL"> Mandragora Farms</font> by any chance? If I were you, I'd think again about visiting there. It's a very unsettling place.<br>
The owner is<font color="LEVEL"> Aaron Nightshade</font>. No one knows where he comes from or what he used to do. There are more than a few things about him that are fishy. Anyway, if I were you, I would never go there.<br>

He makes me shiver. He looks weird and gives you goose bumps when you get close. Now that I think about it, I really don't know anything about him. In fairness, I should say that Herven here says he's a good fellow ...<br>
