Welcome to the Hall of Magic. My fellow Magisters and I are dispatched from Oren's Ivory Tower to instruct seekers of wisdom here in Giran.<br>
I am sorry, but i cannot initiate you in the magic of the Ivory Tower. Only those of Human birth and with basic magic skills can take my classes. I'm afraid you must go.

Welcome! My fellow Magisters and I were dispatched to the Ivory Tower of Oren in order to instruct Giran's finest youths in the ways of magic.<br>
It looks like you're from a small country school. Did you study at Einhovant's School of Magic? Hmmph! I wonder if you were even taught the basics correctly! I'm a little worried that you won't be able to keep up with my lessons, but...<br>
Well, let's just get started and see how you do. If you don't understand something, don't feel embarrassed to ask.<br>
