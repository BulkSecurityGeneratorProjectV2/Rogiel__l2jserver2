Hmmm, well, it's not that I'm lazy, you see... I simply cannot teach you magic. I am Human and I feel a little uncomfortable teaching something so sensitive to another race... And besides, you're not even a Mystic!

Some time ago, a strange Elemental Summoner visited Anabel. It seems that she was a former paramour of the old Lord of Innadril. They had apparently been together for a century or more! You wouldn't know it to look at her, but she is as old as your grandmother's grandmother. Regardless, I still can't condone those kind of Human-Elf relationships. They're unnatural! Tell me, how would you feel knowing that your lover would stay forever young, even as you became old and gray?<br>

Are you kidding? How dare you go around killing people indiscriminately! Did you think there would be no consequence of your actions? I cannot send you through the Gate of Space and Time. You must find another method of transport.
