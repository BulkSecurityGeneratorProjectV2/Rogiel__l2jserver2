Ha, you must be crazy! You don't know the difference between an Elf and a Dark Elf, or a Human and an Orc! I'll bet you don't even know the difference between a Fighter and a Mystic! Do you know how to read? Or can you see the word 'Magister' written right here? Why are you bothering me?<br>
I already have so many problems, I mean, my Master whines about a bad dream he had, golems rampaging about eye balls flying around, the Sea of Spores is expanding every day, Mitraell is locked up somewhere, I am terribly overworked, and now the sun is shining in my eyes and some weird fellow comes up and asks 'Will you teach me magic?'<br>
Please leave me alone! By the way, if you are a cleric, you are definitely in the wrong place.

Should I let this one live or not? Ah, I was just talking to myself.<br>
Why are you here? Grand Magister Fairen has a terrible headache, so bother him at your peril. Like him, I hate to be bothered because of trivialities...<br>
