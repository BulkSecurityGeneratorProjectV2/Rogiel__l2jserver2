I don't think that you're somebody I can teach. Why don't you go upstairs? Gauen is younger that other Elves, but he might be an excellent teacher for you. On the other hand, there is also Kaiena. She may be a little difficult to deal with at times, but she is an accomplished magus.<br>
Be aware that we don't deal with clerics here. If that is your calling, you'd best go to a temple.

Welcome, o seeker of truth, to the Ivory Tower!<br>
Magic is both a tool and a weapon, capable of great good or horrific evil. Even some of our most illustrious wizards have strayed into dark paths over the years.

My master's name was Metheus. He was an indomitable Human, unafraid of making mistakes in his quest for knowledge. His thousands of magical experiments have borne bountiful fruit, transforming how many of us now see magic. Perhaps his most useful research concerned the "magic boost." It has often been misused, but working with his original discoveries we have begun to  develop some more stable refinements. Perhaps you've heard of the <font color="LEVEL">spiritshot</font>?
