You still want to learn magic from me after all you've seen? If you still trust me, I'll teach you, but I can't do anything without my magic staff! I'm a bit stiff at the moment, and I can't hold it in my mouth! Ha! No, this won't work at all! You must find another magician whose body is still intact!

Arghh! What now?! Oh, are you here to see me? Well, feel free to laugh. I've been working on a spell to make my body as pliable as rubber. As you can see, it's had rather the opposite effect. Well, that's the nature of experimentation, eh? No risk, no reward.<br>
Perhaps you'd like to give it a try? What's the worst that could happen?<br>
