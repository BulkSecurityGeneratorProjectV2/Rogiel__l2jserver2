The king of this country so focused on foreign intrigues that he is blind to the revolt brewing in his own capital!<br>
There are dozens of plots, cabals and conspiracies to dethrone him and take over this castle. Those self-righteous Elves may frown and sniff at the goings-on, but we Dark Elves would never criticize. It's just the way of things. Humans may talk like Elves, but they inevitably behave like Dark Elves. It's just their nature...<br>

I'm dreadfully sorry but I only teach Dark Elven mages. You should talk to that serious-looking fellow over there. He specializes in Dark Elven warriors. Only Dark Elves are allows in this guild.
