The Chamber of Delusion is a dream maze discovered not long ago. Like Rim Kamaloka, it is presumed to be the power of darkness invading our world.<br>
It exists in the empty space between dream worlds. In terms of shape and structure, we presume it is related to the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Rift</font>, but we don't know details.<br>
What we do know is that there are rewards for defeating the enemies who inhabit this place. If you have the courage, perhaps you would be interested in challenging the Chamber of Delusion.<br>

Once you enter the Chamber of Delusion, you will find managers for each area. There are 6 total, entry to which is regulated in the individual manager. Ask each manager for more details.<br>
If you've been to the Dimensional Rift, you will understand quickly.<br>
