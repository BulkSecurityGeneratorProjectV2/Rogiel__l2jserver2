There are rules to the<font color="LEVEL"> Rift of Dimension</font>. Where you go and what goes on inside there remains a mystery. Once you get inside using the fragment, you'll only be able to stay for<font color="LEVEL"> about 40 minutes</font> before<font color="LEVEL"> the dimension shifts</font>. Don't forget that.<br>
If you don't like where you entered, you can<font color="LEVEL"> move just once</font>.<br>
This decision must be made by<font color="LEVEL"> the party leader</font>.<br>
You may not leave the party or allow anyone else to join your party while there, it's too dangerous.<br>

The Rift has levels based on what you are responsible for.<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> The 30th level force consists of recruits, the 40th soldiers, the 50th officers, the 60th generals, the 70th commanders, and the higher force heroes</font>. You are free to choose the level that fits you.<br>

Welcome to the rift between the dimensions of time and space! Where you're standing now is relatively safe. It was created using all available resources. By the way, I see that inner space where you're looking, and I must warn you... We can't guarantee your safety! Don't try to go there without our help!<br>
Don't forget! You'll have a better chance of returning alive if you take some friends with you. What do you want to do?<br>
