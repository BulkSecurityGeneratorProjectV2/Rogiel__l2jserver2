I am Gilmore, watcher of the beast Antharas...<br>
I must monitor every breath that demon dragon takes, every twitch of its mighty tail, to assure that it does not awaken from its deep sleep. I have watched the beast for 1,000 years, since I had an army against him. We were able to subdue the beast, but he must be watched.<br>
Do you truly desire to face Antharas, the Land Dragon? He is imprisoned in cave with no entryway. There is only one way in or out... The<font color="LEVEL"> Heart of Warding</font>...<br>

... The Heart of Warding is a doorway that was made by those who imprisoned Antharas... A <font color="LEVEL">Portal Stone</font> activates it. <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Theodric</font> distributes Portal stones to those who have been approved by the seal watchmen.<br>
If you wish to obtain a Portal Stone, you should go and see Gabrielle. Gain her approval and then come back to see me...<br>
