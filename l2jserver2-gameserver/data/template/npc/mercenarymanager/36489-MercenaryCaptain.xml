Are you interested in signing on as a mercenary for this Territory War? 
I'll be honest with you -- the lord here is doing pretty well for himself. 
Serve him well and you can acquire whatever you want.<br>

As the war dragged on, those in power sought for a way to wage the conflict without risking their own positions.
Politics, eh? No rich lord wants to weaken the strength of his loyal troops if he doesn't have to.<br>
So hiring mercenaries like us to fight their battles for them became an easy option.<br>
And, I gotta admit, it's a good way for a soldier to make money.
Win on the battlefield and you'll earn fame and fortune at the same time.<br>
But remember one thing... You must always fight as well as you can, no matter who has hired you.
