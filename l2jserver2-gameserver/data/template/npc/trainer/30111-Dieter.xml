I only teach Human Mystics. I am sorry but I cannot help you. There now, don't be too disappointed -- you will certainly find one whom you will be able to call teacher.

Welcome, you who seeks the truth of evil magic. Your eyes shine with the desire for learning. Yes, you should be greedy for knowledge if you ever hope to become a powerful wizard.<br>
But even here there are boundaries, areas that must not be transgressed. An excess of curiosity can lead to self-destruction, my young friend, so be careful.<br>
Now then, shall we begin?<br>

And after I just warned you about the dangerous curiosity... Tut tut!<br>
Well, best you hear it from me, I suppose, rather than discover it for yourself. You have heard of the wizard named Hardin, have you not? He is a Necromancer who studies the Dark Magic prohibited by the commandments of the Ivory Tower.<br>
It corrupts its users and leads to destruction...it must be avoided like a contagion. Sadly, many capable wizards have allowed themselves to be persuaded by Hardin's parlor tricks and become his pupils. We are not safe from his influence, even here. Always be on guard!<br>
