Welcome, young friend. Welcome to Dion! I am Lucas, the man responsible for the security of Dion. Is this your first time to Dion? I don't know what brought you here, but bear in mind that this is a quiet and law-abiding town. I don't tolerate anyone looking only to disturb the peace!<br>
When you decide to leave, be warned that there are a number of dangerous areas outside the town. I'd advise that you venture out only in a group. Have a nice stay!<br>

Kamaloka is an invader from another world. We do not know precisely when it happened, but we discovered a sealed space, similar to a Dimensional Rift. We call it Kamaloka.<br>
To enter it, you must meet certain requirements. You cannot enter a basic Kamaloka alone. If you wish to fight alone, find the Pathfinders who can lead you to a Rim Kamaloka.<br>
On the other hand, there is an upper limit to how many can enter. More than 6 characters cannot enter it. <br>
You should also be well-rested before entering. According to the priests, it requires a similar amount of energy as entering the Sealed Dimension. Unless your soul is well rested, you will not be allowed in.<br>
Each Kamaloka possesses a certain level; only characters near that level may enter. <br>
There are also several kinds of Kamaloka. Even if they appear to be the same Kamaloka or Near Kamaloka, they are divided into several patterns. So far, two distinct patterns have been identified: Hall and Labyrinth. You may only enter the Hall type now, and soon you will be able to enter the Labyrinth. <br>
(In real time, you can enter a regular Kamaloka and Near Kamaloka once per day. You need 3000 PC cafe points in order to enter the Near Kamaloka.) <br>
(Only characters whose levels are 5 levels higher or lower than the Kamaloka's levels may enter.)

Researchers at the Ivory Tower believe that Kamaloka is a result of another dimension overlapping Aden. The monsters of Kamaloka are tremendously powerful. Adventurers must take care to enter only the Kamaloka appropriate for their level.<br>
