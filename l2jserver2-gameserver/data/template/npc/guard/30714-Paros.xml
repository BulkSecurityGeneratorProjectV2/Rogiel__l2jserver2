Where are you off to? If you're going to Castle Aden just follow this path to the north. There really isn't anyone living to the east of the town. Are you going to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of Mirrors?</font><br>
After you pass the forest, you'll see one of the most beautiful places on the continent, <font color="LEVEL">Angel Falls.</font> Despite its beauty it is a dangerous place, so don't go there if you aren't prepared for a good fight.<br>

The waterfall descends from the Lost Plateau, higher than the clouds. It is the highest waterfall on the continent, legend says that it was made by the power of gods... The legend also says that the nest of a vicious creature is hidden inside the waterfall.<br>
The creature masquerades in human form and devours unsuspecting passersby... A few years ago a search party entered the waterfall looking for a missing person and only one, a Cleric, returned. He too, expired shortly afterward, saying 'zahak' before dying ... <br>
I have no idea what that means... Possibly the monster's name? Anyway after hearing that word many Magisters went pale. But the Grand Magister whispered something to them and they all kept quiet.<br>

The forest seems to be nothing but trees and fog. Legend says the doppelganger takes its victims here.<br>
A few months ago a farmer thought that he saw one but it was only his friends playing a joke on him...<br>
However, the forest remains a dangerous place, you must never forget that...<br>
