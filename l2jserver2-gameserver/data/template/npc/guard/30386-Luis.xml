Somewhere in that wide field that stretches out before me, the <font color="LEVEL">demon Beleth</font> lies asleep. I heard that the reason the south of Gludio became the Wasteland and the insects and spiders grew monstrously large is because Beleth breathes out foul magic as he lies sealed underground. <br>
Recently, the <font color="LEVEL">giant ants</font> have begun openly foraging out of the Wastelands and are giving our guards headaches.<br>

Beleth is a demon that led the legions of the undead, and attempted to make an eternal empire of darkness in this land. However, the wise men of the Ivory Tower and the Elven Mystics joined forces, and with their powers sealed him underground.<br>
Some people say that Beleth was originally a Mystic, but became a demon after studying forbidden black magic. Well ... If that is true, doesn't that mean that there could always be another evil Mystic like him? You really can't trust Mystics!<br>

They are ants that have grown huge because of the magic forces that Beleth breathes out. They have dug a great cave in the middle of the crude Wasteland and live in a large colony.<br>
Sometimes foreigners fall into the Ant Nest and become their prey. If you're going out into the Wasteland, you must be careful.<br>
