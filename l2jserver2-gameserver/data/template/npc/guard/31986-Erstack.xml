The shallow graves of exiled Tribal Chiefts! Most of those chiefs were murdered, but death could not contain their vengeful fury!<br>
What? ...The Immortal Plateau? Who cares about Orcish tombs, anyway. A tomb's a tomb, right? We'll all get one eventually! Gah, it's cold! I just want a swig of Kofporch and my bed!<br>

Hmm, how to explain it.... Basically, the ruins are haunted! At one time it was a thriving Orcish city, but now it's just a shell of its former self. Only inhabitants you'll find out there are evil spirits and insects! They say that if you bury a bottle of liquor under the ruins, you'll get an amazing Kofporch! I've heard there's even an old Kofporch jug buried under the Beacon Mound of Pa'agrio! If I could have a glass of that, I'd die a warm and happy man!<br>

Brrr! It's freezing out here! Nothing like a mug of Kofporch to thicken the blood on a day like this. What? You've never heard of Kofporch? Where've you been, kiddo? Were you born yesterday?<br>
Kofporch is only brewed in a few areas in Schuttgart Territory. The best kinds are then hauled out and left to age in either the<font color="LEVEL"> Den of Evil</font> or the<font color="LEVEL"> Crypts of Disgrace</font>. Dangerous? Sure! But believe you me, no imitation even comes close!<br>
