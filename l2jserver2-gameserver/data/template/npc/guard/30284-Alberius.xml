Guardians are guardian spirits of the forest. When the god Einhasad created the Elves from the leaves of the Mother Tree Glade, she also created the guardians to protect the forest which would be the Elves' home. They are still loyal to their first purpose, and are very hostile to other races that invade the forest. Even Elves, if they injure their own kind, are dealt with ferociously.<br>

Sentinels are also called the guardians of the forest, or watchmen of the fresh green. We are fighters who have guarded the Elven Forest from outside threats for hundreds of years. The orcs of the Fog Mountains, greedy Humans trying to increase their land, and our dark Elven brothers of the north -- all have attacked this place many times. Each time we defend ourselves, and they learn a harsh lesson about underestimating the sentinels.<br>
Once there were many sentinels, not only around the village, but also posted as lookouts on the boundaries of the forest. However, now there are less than one hundred sentinels, so we rely on the <font color="LEVEL">guardians</font> to defend the forest beyond the village.<br>

May the divine protection of Eva be with you. I am Sentinel Knight Smallberry, commander of the <font color="LEVEL">Sentinels</font> that guard the holy forest and the Mother Tree Glade.<br>
The building you see behind me is the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctuary of Eva</font> -- the elders that guide the Elves of Light dwell here. It is also a place for young Elves to train in swordsmanship and magic.<br>
