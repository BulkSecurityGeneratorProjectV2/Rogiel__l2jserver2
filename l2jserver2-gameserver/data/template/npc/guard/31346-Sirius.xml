The<font color="LEVEL"> von Hellmanns</font> were aristocrats who ruled the manor in the eastern section of Rune. They gained power after their distinguished service in the war with Aden. But the revolt was their undoing! They were all brutally massacred! Now the mere mention of their name can be deadly... Watch what you say around here!<br>
If you visit the<font color="LEVEL"> Forest of the Dead</font>, you should really be careful! Legend says that the von Hellmann Family has all turned into<font color="LEVEL"> blood-drinking creatures</font> roaming about the forest. Oh well, one shouldn't listen to rumors, I suppose... But you can't be too careful!<br>

Yep, blood-sucking vampires, buddy! Have you heard about the one that looks like a beautiful woman? She seduces people and then sucks their blood! They die if they're lucky! The really unlucky ones turn into vampires! I've been carrying around a holy symbol and cloves of garlic since I heard about that one! I've got a wife and children to think about!<br>

Well, let's see.. My hometown is in ruins! And now, vicious beasts are trying to kill me every time I turn around... You'd be grumpy too!<br>
My hometown was a small, peaceful village in the manor ruled by the von Hellmann family. It was an humble village, inhabited by hunters and lumberjacks. The people there were drawn into the revolt and killed, including my entire family...<br>
I'd prefer that the village had burnt to the ground, but still it exists... A wicked shell of its former self, inhabited only by evil spirits and ghosts. Never go there after dark!<br>
