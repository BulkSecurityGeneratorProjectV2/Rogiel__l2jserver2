Perhaps you already know this, but Talking Island is where the Elves first taught magic to Humans. The<font color="LEVEL"> ruins</font> in the north used to be a school that the Elves built to teach magic a long time ago.<br>
Now all the Elves have left, although some say that there are a few who have stayed on, but no one knows how old they are.<br>

It used to be the Elven school of magic, but it has become a ruin since it was abandoned a long time ago. It is very dangerous now because of the undead and spirits that roam the dust-filled corridors. Of course, a few fellows have set off for the place with hopes of finding forgotten treasure.<br>
To go to The Elven Ruins, you must first find the Obelisk of Victory which is on this road to the northeast. Once at the obelisk, the road forks into two -- take the one that goes to the east and you'll see the entrance to the ruins on the side of the mountain ridge.
