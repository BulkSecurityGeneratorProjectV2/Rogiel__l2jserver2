I will tell you a story, one of ancient immorality.<br>
Once there lived a beautiful princess, in a far away land. Her beauty was so renowned that her mother, the Queen, grew jealous and plotted to have her killed. When the King discovered her evil plot he tried to stop it. This enraged the wicked Queen further, so much so that she sent a killer for the King as well.<br>
Needless to say, the country fell into a state of anarchy and civil war. The love the princess felt for her mother slowly turned to sadness, and the sadness to hatred. This hatred grew until all she could hold in her hear was the desire to see her mother dead. She placed whatever lov, sadness and sympathy that was left in her heart in a small jeweled box and gave it to a nobleman.<br>
Unfortunately... that is all I know of this story.<br>
