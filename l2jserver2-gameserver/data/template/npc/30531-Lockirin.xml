This association consists of representatives from the <font color="LEVEL">six guilds</font> that are the most powerful among the hundreds of Dwarven guilds. Due to the lack of a king, all the important policies are determined by the Senior Association. Together they rule this the Kingdom of the Dwarves, until the king returns.<br>

The top six guilds are: the Golden Wheel, the Silver Scale, the Bronze Key, the Black Anvil, the Gray Column, and the Iron Gate, to which I belong. If you want to know more about other guilds, just ask the Elders here. All of them can easily brag about their guilds for hours, so you are likely to learn more than you wanted.<br>

Our guild is the largest and most powerful of the six guilds that define Dwarven society. We boast of a tradition of nearly one thousand years as a prestigious union of famous traders and powerful bankers. Our guild runs warehouses in almost every city of the continent.<br>
We do not pay heed to the boundaries drawn by Humans! Wherever there are customers -- from the snowy fields of Lansk to the faraway land of Kandeef across the ocean -- we do business with all who want to trade! That is the spirit of independence embodied by our Iron Gate Guild.<br>

Welcome, young friend, to the House of Elders. My name is Lockirin Stonecutter. I am the eldest Master of the <font color="LEVEL">Iron Gate Guild</font> and also the First Elder of the <font color="LEVEL">Association of Guild Elders</font>. These titles sound fine enough, but really my job is to keep these headstrong old chaps in line.<br>
