Well, the Cokrakon� they might be the strangest of the life forms in this Seed. From a distance, you might mistake one for a man, but up close, their true form is revealed. Their appearance and behavior resembles that of territorial birds of prey. As with the other clans, they are capable of acts of nightmarish violence, but the one thing that will catch you off guard... their strange cry could make your head split open.<br>Some of the more intellectually curious minds among my soldiers talk of some evolutionary resemblence between the Bistakon and Cokrakon. I really couldn't say. In any case, be extremely careful here.

The Reptilikons were the most familiar to us when we crashed here because they superficially resemble the Lizardmen clans. However, as I said, the resemblence is purely superficial. They don't seem to have any advanced social structure beyond the tendency to travel in herds and devour everything in sight. Just about every Reptilikon possesses a deadly poisonous bite.<br>Of the clans of Seed beasts, they seem to be the most prolific. In any case, if you value your life, be careful here.

The Bistakon� well, the Bistakon are the one clan in this seed that most resembles the race of man. However, they are a twisted reflection of the most bestial motives and intentions within man's heart. They are wont to acts of extreme violence, tearing their prey limb from limb. There are even reports that they will devour each other when other forms of prey are unavailable.<br>If you are caught in their powerful claws, they will never let go and you may never stop the bleeding. As with the other clans of the Seed, we know nothing about their origins or whether they evolved from some other form. In any case, you must be extremely careful here.

The day that our fleet all went down in the Seed of Annihilation... I could hear the screams of my subordinates as they disappeared, but I had to leave them all behind and escape from that place with Ermian.<br>
Still, even as a soldier, I don't regret my decision. But I can't help but feel regret about the deaths of my subordinates. I can still hear their cries. <br>
I was completely helpless as my subordinates perished... This is really sad. It was all my fault...<br>
Are you also headed for the Seed of Annihilation? Then listen well. I will tell you how to survive in that hellish place...<br>

Ugh, where should I begin? There's a lot to say about this place, none of it good. But if you want to survive here, you'd do well to listen. The Seed of Annihilation is crawling with psychotic monsters unlike anything you've seen before. There are three clans... or races really, I can't tell that they have any social structure.<br>
We call them the <font color="LEVEL">Bistakon, Cokrakon, and Reptilikon</font>. They are quite distint from one another, but the one thing that unites them is a thirst for violence and death. Which do you want to learn about?<br>
