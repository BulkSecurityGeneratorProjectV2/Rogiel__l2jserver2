The <font color="LEVEL">Black Anvil Guild</font> is truly the driving force of the Dwarves' prosperity. While other races were Brandishing their bamboo spears and stone axes, our ancestors had already mastered bronze tools and were studying the secrets of Steel. The Black Anvil Guild continues the traditions of our ancestors through precise workmanship and a noble spirit of craftsmanship.<br>
Our guild has produced all the great craftsmen of the Dwarven society. Our Mithril weapons and adamantite armor are traded at the highest prices in any market. Also, our guild members study the lost science and technology of the giants more deeply than anyone else. The siege golems and airships that we alone create are the results of such studies.<br>

I am Head Blacksmith Bronk, chief craftsman of the <font color="LEVEL">Black Anvil</font> Guild. You have undoubtedly heard of our reputation, so you know of the highly-skilled Artisans and Warsmiths who have risen through our ranks, the foremost craftsmen of the age. Without the resources of the Black Anvil Guild, a Dwarf is as useless as two pennies without a purse to carry them in. You have a bright and eager look about you; what errand has brought you to my door?<br>
