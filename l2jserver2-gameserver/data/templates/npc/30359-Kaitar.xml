May the holy darkness of the abyss fill the land.<br>
I am Tetrarch Kaitar, prophet of the darkness chosen by <font color="LEVEL">Gran Kain</font>, father of darkness. I follow <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font>, mother of the abyss, and am the black priest who interprets Shilen's will.<br>
Goddess of death and destiny, Shilen sometimes gives me the ability to see into the future. For many generations my family has been born with the ability to predict the future by tossing the bones of the dead and looking at the fallen shapes, or by gazing into the eyes of the dead. In the current situation, with enemies surrounding us, it is my task to foresee the disasters that may threaten the future of our race.<br>

<font color="LEVEL">Gran Kain</font> -- Sovereign of Destruction, Father of Darkness! If the sunlight that pierces our eyes was made by Einhasad, then the darkness that swallows the light was made by the Dark Lord, Gran Kain. Other races call Gran Kain a devil, fear him and exclude his followers.<br>
However, as the late afternoon shadow slowly overtakes the land, the power of Gran Kain will surpass all other gods -- and when the light is put out, flames extinguished, and the wind dies, the ground will part and all rivers and oceans will become dry. Then, only darkness will remain...<br>

Shilen, Mother of the Abyss, is the Goddess who controls fate and death. Shilen permits all life to be limited, and it is she who enables death, so that all living things can return to their original state of nothingness. Other races do not understand the eternal cycle of birth and death. They only see one side of death, and fear and hate Shilen.<br>
Because of these prejudices, in the Human Kingdom, the mark of Shilen hanging around one's neck will lead to being burnt at the stake for heresy. In spite of this persecution, there are secret groups of Humans who follow the goddess Shilen. In a sense, their faith is the same as the Dark Elves. If only we could know who they were.<br>
