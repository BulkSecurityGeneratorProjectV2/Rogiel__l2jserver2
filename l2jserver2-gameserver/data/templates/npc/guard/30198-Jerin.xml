Eh, nice weather, eh stranger? I've been a guard for a long time but, honestly, I've never even gotten a scratch in the line of duty. I am lucky. Really, even though you're a skilled adventurer, you'll never be able to beat someone who's lucky. One of my friends... He was so drunk one time, he didn't even have his armor on, went and wandered off by the <font color="LEVEL">protection towers,</font>, near the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font> to take a leak, and didn't even see a monster. Lucky bastard.<br>

You will see strange towers northwest of the town. Past the towers you will find the Sea of Spores. Fungus, mushrooms and other unusual plants grow there... You wouldn't catch me dead there.<br>
It is said that humans and elves fought there long ago, and the elves made a huge mistake. Before dying of a mysterious disease, a traveler reported seeing a large turtle's shell and a giant statue of a goddess roaming thereabouts.<br>

the mages of the Ivory Tower joined with the Elves to build the Protection Tower at the center of the Sea of Spores. It was supposedly erected to halt the spread of the Sea of Spores but there is no evidence it is working... I think it more likely they are up to something...<br>
