May the authority of Gran Kain command the world.<br>
I am Tetrarch Talloth of the Dark Elves -- heir of the dark Runsord Vellisark and the royal knight of <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Mitraell</font>. I am the envoy of Gran Kain who leads the hosts of darkness to the battlefield.<br>
A thousand years have passed since Mitraell was sealed away by the wicked schemes of Wizards in the Ivory Tower. I have been staying at this place where he lies, and have cared for his safety and guarded him from danger ever since. When he is free, we will gain victory over the dark temple and rule the continent once more.<br>

Hierarch Mitraell is our leader who rules the entire clan. He is the Sorcerer who inherited the secrets of black magic from the powerful Dasparion. He also holds the ultimate magical power, due to a contract with Drevanul.<br>
When war with the Elves of light was at its height, Human Mystics took sides with the Elves of light and cast strong sealing spells on Mitraell. Because of this, the morale of our forces was broken, and just as we were about to win the war, we had no choice but to retreat. Our Patriarch was a political leader, but also the central source of the black magic used by our race. Losing that power meant that our magic was greatly weakend.<br>
We four Tetrarchs all served Mitraell in the past and are constantly looking for a way to undo his seal. The seal will be broken someday, let there be no doubt!<br>
